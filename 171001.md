We released this version early because of confusion with the account registration process. We now present the Cloud Wallet as the default login. In the past, we have referred to this as the Account Model, however, it's ambiguous using the word account to differentiate the two types of accounts considering both types have accounts in them. We also fixed a bug in the referral link that has been around for a long time but was only recently discovered. This failed to credit referrals if the URL contained a trailing `/`. In the process, we also discovered (but have not found the root cause), that our initial scan through nodes is buggy and can lead to a node not being selected the first time a new user arrives. A manual screen refresh seems to solve the problem most of the time. I have booked this as a critical bug so we hope to have it resolved by the regular 171015 release.
