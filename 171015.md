We've completely rewritten the Portfolio / Open Orders / Margin Positions and Activity screens. They all fall neatly under the Dashboard. Other noteable features include:
- Price of asset display
- Margin position Price / Call price display
- Margin Position color indicator in header when ratio dips to critical levels
- Summary of values for each of My Portfolio / Open Orders / Margin Positions tying back to overall account value.

- We have incorporated an optional QR code in place of the identicon now. All you have to do is click on it to change it permanently, or click again to switch it back. Clicking the Deposit BTS button also changes it. Also added text to explain that the username is their address.
- We fixed a serious issue related to the initial socket connection and also got to the root of a problem related to the latency reporting of eligible nodes.
- We also applied the new table stying to the accounts screen.

Future plans include:
- Continued conversion of the remaining tables
- Tradingview library to replace existing exchange charting
- Redesigned menu and header
- More thorough responsive design
- Redesigned Deposit / Withdrawal / Send screens
