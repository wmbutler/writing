# Summary

In 171101 we present a completely re-imagined voting area and made over 30 improvements including a few minor bug fixes. We still have some known issues with latency reporting on node selection that we will continue to pursue in future releases.

# New and Improved

We've completely rewritten the voting area to adopt the same UI as the Dashboard. We also addressed some shortcomings of the previous UI

[voting area]

- Notification for Saving your vote is more prominent
- We removed a lot of the instructions but linked to updated help documentation
- Included line numbers for witnesses, committees and workers
- Separated workers into Proposed / Active / Expired
- Display **votes required to activate**
- Display total and remaining budget on active worker page 

The asset explorer now shows Margin Positions with ratios. This means that cryptofresh is no longer the only source for viewing.

Your orders are now displayed in bold in the exchange order book

Connection Status has been added to the exchange area and clicking on it takes the user to the Settings screen.

Trollbox has been completely removed and the help menu takes the user to help pages which contains links to Discord, Telegram and of course in-wallet help.

In cases where users switched from one trading pair to another on the exchange, order input fields would remain populated. Fields are now cleared appropriately.

The Portfolio tab on the user dashboard is now sortable.

## Announcement
In an effort to address a security concern, we are planning to migrate web users to https://wallet.bitshares.org from https://bitshares.org/wallet. This will happen at the next Sprint 171115. We plan to make it as easy as possible. No need to worry about this until that time.

### Bitshares Light Client (Downloaded Client)
This won't affect you. Just download the newest version as usual

### Cloud Wallet Users
All you need to do is change your bookmark to https://wallet.bitshares.org. You will need to reset all your preferred markets and for that we are sorry for the inconveience.

### Local Wallet Users
If access a local wallet from https://bitshares.org/wallet, you will need to take a backup of your .bin file then import it into http://wallet.bitshares.org.


# Future plans include:
- A new header menu
- Redesigned Deposit / Withdrawal / Send / Buy screens
- Tradingview integration
